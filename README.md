# Stenograph

Everything is an image. Images are matrices. Matrices multiply.

Stenograph is a small steganography and image-cipher playground. It turns text,
audio, and images into 1024x1024 PNGs, transforms images with visual keys, and
can recover useful output from those images without PNG metadata.

## What It Does

- Image x key -> transformed image, using a separate visual key image.
- Text -> image -> text, with redundant pixel voting and CRC checks.
- Audio -> image -> audio in two browser modes:
  - `PCM exact`: stores 16-bit PCM bytes for PNG-only round trips.
  - `Fourier robust`: stores a frequency image with phase vectors. The red
    channel is the drawable frequency map; green/blue preserve phase for audible
    round trips. Span presets trade quality for duration: ~24s, ~60s, or ~3min.
    Tracks longer than the selected span are fitted into it and expanded back.
- Image -> cover image -> image, using low-bit image-in-image storage.
- Photo extract: finds a photographed Stenograph square and rectifies it back to
  1024x1024.

## Web App

The deployable app lives in `stenograph-web/`.

```bash
cd stenograph-web
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
```

The production output is `stenograph-web/dist/`.

## Cloudflare Worker

Live Worker URL:

```text
https://stenograph.bileter.workers.dev
```

Deploy the built Vite app as Worker static assets:

```bash
cd stenograph-web
npm run deploy:worker
```

This runs `npm run build` and then publishes `stenograph-web/dist/` to the
Cloudflare Worker named `stenograph`.

## Cloudflare Pages

If using Pages instead of the Worker URL above, use these Pages settings:

- Build command: `npm run build`
- Build output directory: `dist`
- Root directory: `stenograph-web`
- Production branch: `main`

Pushing to GitHub `main` should trigger the Cloudflare Pages build if the
project is connected to `Jirnyak/stenograph`.

## Python CLI

`steno.py` is the main CLI implementation.

```bash
python steno.py keygen
python steno.py encrypt image.png output.png
python steno.py decrypt image.png output.png
python steno.py text2img "hello" text.png
python steno.py img2text text.png
python steno.py audio2img music.wav spectrum.png
python steno.py img2audio spectrum.png recovered.wav
python steno.py hideimg cover.png secret.png hidden.png 4
python steno.py revealimg hidden.png revealed.png auto
```

Several root-level Python files are older experiments and prototypes. The
current architecture is documented in `architecture.md`.

## Format Rules

- Output files are normal images; payload facts live in pixels, not PNG metadata.
- Keys are separate files and are not embedded in encrypted output.
- Keep PNG for exact byte/image-in-image modes.
- Use `Fourier robust` when the image should survive compression or be edited as
  a frequency drawing. Use a longer Fourier span for full songs, or `PCM exact`
  when PNG-only audio recovery matters more than editable image behavior.
